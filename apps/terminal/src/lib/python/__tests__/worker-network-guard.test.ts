/**
 * The Python worker runs code the user did not necessarily write — an
 * installed plugin can contribute indicator scripts through the
 * `chart:indicator` capability, and a script exported from the workbench
 * travels as a plugin zip. Pyodide hands that code the JS globals through its
 * `js` module, so `js.fetch(...)` from Python is an ordinary call. The worker
 * shipped with no guard installed at all while the plugin sandbox next door
 * stripped storage globals and enforced a per-plugin allowlist.
 *
 * The guard is verified end to end in a PRODUCTION build in the browser (boot
 * Pyodide, pull numpy from jsDelivr, deny example.com) — a dev server cannot
 * stand in for it, since Vite inlines the worker into a Blob only at build
 * time and the Blob is what makes the same-origin entry hard to get right.
 * What is pinned here is the allowlist itself, because it is the part that can
 * silently rot: drop a host and the runtime stops booting, add one and the
 * boundary quietly widens.
